  Hi,

  I am a technically focused developer and architect with a PhD in nuclear physics, possessing a rare combination of deep technical understanding and strategic leadership experience from C-level roles. I practice value-based leadership that fosters trust and collaboration, creating ownership and motivation within my teams through the clear communication of goals.

  My expertise spans from low-level system programming to modern Web3 architecture and cloud-based microservices, enabling me to deliver solutions that unite scientific precision with commercial value. I thrive in bridging the gap between business and technology, humanizing technology, designing sustainable, high-performance systems that solve actual business needs even within strict regulatory frameworks. As a quality-conscious and results-oriented professional, I bring infectious enthusiasm to multidisciplinary teams in both distributed and co-located environments.

          At DNB Carnegie, I work as a System Developer on two major initiatives: Project FIND and the Murex implementation.

          For the FIND project, I help establish a central Master Data Management system for financial instruments, designing a scalable data model to import data from sources like Bloomberg and Nordic Bond Pricing. I also implement integrations to export this data to Murex and build a frontend for the business side to manage financial instruments.

          Regarding the Murex project, I focus on integrating the trading platform with DNB Carnegie's existing portfolio, a.o. by implementing a backend solution for reporting money market data to the Central Banks of Norway and Sweden using ISO 20022 standards. My work ensures simplified trading flows and optimized cost structures for data collection.

          As a System Developer and architect for the CBDC Retail Sandbox project of the Central Bank of Norway, I was responsible for the management, design, and implementation of a technical sandbox to evaluate Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

          We designed a comprehensive architecture that included a private Ethereum-based blockchain backend, specialized smart contracts, and a frontend interface. My role involved developing these smart contracts to support various retail payment scenarios and integrating the frontend with third-party authentication solutions. Additionally, we provided strategic advice to the Central Bank of Norway on critical technical decisions, such as the choice of token standards and bridge technologies. 

          This contribution has enabled the Central Bank of Norway to test a broad spectrum of scenarios and build solid first-hand expertise with key components of the blockchain ecosystem.

          During my tenure as CSO and CTO at Nahmii, I led the architecture and development of our 2nd layer scaling solutions for Ethereum, spanning versions 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0.

          The Nahmii solution focuses on addressing critical scaling issues by minimizing transaction costs and latency while ensuring immediate finality and increasing bandwidth. For Nahmii 1.0, we designed a hybrid solution that combined decentralized applications with a client-server model to handle high transaction rates. Later, I directed the implementation of Nahmii 2.0 as an Ethereum-compatible platform and Nahmii 3.0 as an Ethereum-equivalent solution, allowing standard Ethereum contracts to be utilized with little to no modification.

          My role involved technical leadership for teams ranging from 5 to 20 developers and operations engineers, where I oversaw the development of smart contracts, microservices, SDKs, and frontends. Additionally, I enjoyed business development towards new and existing customers and setting up service environments for standard lifecycle stages.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          As a Senior Consultant at Webstep, I currently leverage my expertise to modernize financial infrastructure for DNB Carnegie, focusing on cost optimization and operational stability through the FIND and Murex projects. My work designing scalable data models and automating trading flows has reinforced the importance of robust architecture in high-stakes financial environments.

          Previously, I delivered social value through Webstep's Project Samla, where I architected a serverless AWS solution that empowers municipalities with data to improve public health decision-making. My extensive tenure with Statoil allowed me to transition between roles as a System Developer, Architect, and Business Process Modeler, teaching me how to effectively bridge the gap between complex technical implementations and strategic business needs. There, I enhanced operational workflows and compliance by harmonizing governing documentation and developed a well-completion system. Engagements with clients like Avinor and Delfi Data further broadened my industry scope, ranging from aviation data integration to banking advisory tools.

          Throughout these projects, I have learned to navigate strict regulatory frameworks while delivering high-performance solutions, whether visualizing seismic data for the oil industry or managing sensitive financial instruments. This diverse experience has honed my ability to unite scientific precision with commercial value, ensuring technical decisions directly support the customer's core objectives.

          The Nahmii architecture offers unprecedented scalability of Ethereum equivalent blockchains.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my tenure as CSO and CTO at Nahmii, I led the strategic architecture and development of our 2nd layer Ethereum scaling solutions, evolving the platform through three major versions to address critical bottlenecks like transaction costs and latency. This work provided significant value by delivering immediate finality and high bandwidth, managed through technical leadership of development teams and operations engineers. 

          I also took on a hands-on role as System Developer and Architect for the Norwegian Central Bank, where I managed the design and implementation of a technical sandbox to evaluate Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). This contribution was vital in enabling the Norwegian Central Bank to test retail payment scenarios practically, thereby building solid, first-hand expertise within the blockchain ecosystem. My time at Nahmii thus spanned from high-level executive strategy and business development to deep technical implementation, bridging the gap between commercial scaling needs and national financial experimentation.
